ci-cd pipeline concept works in following order

* Run tests
* build docker Image
* push to docker registry
* deploy to server


Pipeline configuration file
---------------------------------
How do we create a gitlab ci-cd pipeline??
pipeline is scripted means pipeline is written in code and hosted inside applications's git repository

whole CI/CD configuration is written in YAML format and that file should be called as .gitlab-ci.yml.. it should be in route folder

the tasks in he ci-cd pipeline for example these 4 steps and etc. are called as jobs..
jobs are the fundamental building block of a .gitlab-ci.yml file


let's create a job which runs test

run_tests: name of the test
  image: python:3.9-slim-buster
  script: must contain atleast the script clause
    - make test : we say run this command


    here is questioned where and which environment is the job executed??
    pipline jobs are executed in gitlab runners.gitlab runners can be installed in different environment it could be linux windows mac
    executer :
    executer determines the environment each jobs runs in
    for example shell is he simplest executor but another commen execution environment on gitlab is docker container  using docker commands are executed inside container



    // docker image name we ovewrite default gitlab image normally gitlab uses ruby image...now this image make sure python and pip package available inside container.how ever we still don't have make command.to install make command inside python image  before the script runs, we need toadd a nother attribute before_script.. . this is the command that should run before script command


job 2: build docker image and push

variables for login credentials
to pull and push we need docker hub credentials we should not include it inside .gitlab-ci.yaÂ´ml because it's visible we have a seperete section called setting and inside we have also ci-cd iotion there we have several option on eof those is variable there we need to setup variables for credentials basically it would be handled by admin
